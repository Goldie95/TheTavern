The Tavern is a text based adventure game written in Python.

The game is only able to be played in a CMD terminal. 

I created this game to practice my python scripting skills. The game may not
represent the best / usual coding practises but i wanted to play about with using
objects to define the game controls. I also wanted to seperate each 'room' or 
section you visit int he game into different python scripts that can be called in
play loop. 

I thin what i have done so far works ok, there could definitely be improvments,
but for now i think its a fun game to play, but it was much more fun to build it.

testing a change.
